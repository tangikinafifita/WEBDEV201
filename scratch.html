            <h2>The Origins of Bread</h2>
            <p>Bread, in its simplest form, is one of the oldest prepared foods. Its history is deeply intertwined with the development of agriculture and human civilization.</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Early Beginnings:</strong> Evidence suggests that the earliest forms of bread were likely flatbreads made from ground grains and water, cooked on hot stones around 30,000 years ago.</li>
                <li><strong>The Rise of Leavening:</strong> The Egyptians are credited with discovering leavening through wild yeast around 4,000 years ago, leading to the airy and lighter breads we know today.
                    <ul>
                        <li>This discovery revolutionized baking.</li>
                        <li>It allowed for a greater variety of textures and flavors.</li>
                        <li>Leavened bread became a staple food.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Bread Across Cultures:</strong> From the flatbreads of the Middle East and India to the sourdoughs of Europe and the steamed buns of Asia, bread has taken countless forms and holds significant cultural importance worldwide.</li>
            </ol>

            <h2>Different Types of Bread</h2>
            <p>The diversity of bread is truly astounding. Here are just a few examples:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Sourdough:</strong> Characterized by its tangy flavor and chewy texture, made using a live culture of wild yeasts and bacteria.</li>
                <li><strong>Baguette:</strong> A long, thin loaf with a crisp crust and a light, airy interior, a staple in France.</li>
                <li><strong>Ciabatta:</strong> An Italian white bread that is elongated, broad, and somewhat collapsed in the middle, often used for sandwiches.</li>
                <li><strong>Pita:</strong> A round, flatbread popular in the Mediterranean and Middle East, often with a pocket that can be filled.</li>
                <li><strong>Rye Bread:</strong> Made with rye flour, offering a denser texture and earthy flavor.</li>
            </ul>
